This repository contains preliminary experiments and datasets for research into dynamically adjusting the number of retrieved documents (the `k` value) in retrieval augmented generation workflows. It includes:

- CS QA datasets in JSONL format for training and evaluation
- A Jupyter notebook for data preparation
- A small script (`env_check.py`) that verifies the Python environment and model loading
